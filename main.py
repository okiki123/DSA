# Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. 
# She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. 
# She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. 
# Write a function to help Bob locate the card.
